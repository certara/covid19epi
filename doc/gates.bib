	abstract = {Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses are now endemic in avian populations in Southeast Asia, and human cases continue to accumulate. Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission, H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a mutation or reassortment generating a virus with increased transmissibility. Identifying public health interventions that might be able to halt a pandemic in its earliest stages is therefore a priority. Here we use a simulation model of influenza transmission in Southeast Asia to evaluate the potential effectiveness of targeted mass prophylactic use of antiviral drugs as a containment strategy. Other interventions aimed at reducing population contact rates are also examined as reinforcements to an antiviral-based containment policy. We show that elimination of a nascent pandemic may be feasible using a combination of geographically targeted prophylaxis and social distancing measures, if the basic reproduction number of the new virus is below 1.8. We predict that a stockpile of 3 million courses of antiviral drugs should be sufficient for elimination. Policy effectiveness depends critically on how quickly clinical cases are diagnosed and the speed with which antiviral drugs can be distributed.},

	abstract = {Given the limited understanding about pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) determinants of oseltamivir efficacy, data from two phase 2 influenza virus inoculation studies were evaluated. Healthy volunteers in studies 1 and 2 were experimentally infected with influenza A/Texas (the concentration of neuraminidase inhibitor which reduced neuraminidase activity by 50\% [IC50] = 0.18 nM) or B/Yamagata (IC50 = 16.76 nM), respectively. In study 1, 80 subjects received 20, 100, or 200 mg of oral oseltamivir twice daily (BID), 200 mg oseltamivir once daily, or placebo for 5 days. In study 2, 60 subjects received 75 or 150 mg of oral oseltamivir BID or placebo for 5 days. Oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) (active metabolite) PK was evaluated using individual PK data and a population PK model to derive individual values for area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0–24), minimum concentration of OC in plasma (Cmin), and maximum concentration of OC in plasma (Cmax). Exposure-response relationships were evaluated for continuous (area under composite symptom score curve [AUCSC], area under the viral titer curve, and peak viral titer) and time-to-event (alleviation of composite symptom scores and cessation of viral shedding) efficacy endpoints. Univariable analyses suggested the existence of intuitive and highly statistically significant relationships between OC AUC0–24 evaluated as a 3-group variable and AUCSC, time to alleviation of composite symptom scores, and time to cessation of viral shedding. The upper OC AUC0–24 threshold (∼14,000 ng · h/ml) was similar among these endpoints. Multivariable analyses failed to demonstrate the influence of study/strain on efficacy endpoints. These results provide the first demonstration of exposure-response relationships for efficacy for oseltamivir against influenza and suggest that OC exposures beyond those achieved with the approved oseltamivir dosing regimen will provide enhanced efficacy. The clinical applicability of these observations requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: During the 2013-2014 influenza season, Public Health England extended routine influenza vaccination to all 2- and 3-year-old children in England. To estimate the impact of this change in policy on influenza-related morbidity and mortality, we developed a disease transmission and surveillance model informed by real-world data.
METHODS: We combined real-world and literature data sources to construct a model of influenza transmission and surveillance in England. Data were obtained for four influenza seasons, starting with the 2010-2011 season. Bayesian inference was used to estimate model parameters on a season-by-season basis to assess the impact of targeting 2- and 3-year-old children for influenza vaccination. This provided the basis for the construction of counterfactual scenarios comparing vaccination rates of {\textasciitilde}2\% and {\textasciitilde}35\% in the 2- and 3- year-old population to estimate reductions in general practitioner (GP) influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultations, respiratory hospitalizations and deaths in the overall population.
RESULTS: Our model was able to replicate the main patterns of influenza across the four seasons as observed through laboratory surveillance data. Targeting 2- and 3-year-old children for influenza vaccination resulted in reductions in the general population of between 6.2-9.9\% in influenza-attributable GP ILI consultations, 6.1-10.7\% in influenza-attributable respiratory hospitalizations, and 5.7-9.4\% in influenza-attributable deaths. The decrease in influenza-attributable ILI consultations represents a reduction of between 4.5\% and 7.3\% across all ILI consultations. The reduction in influenza-attributable respiratory hospitalizations represents a reduction of between 1.2\% and 2.3\% across all respiratory hospitalizations. Reductions in influenza-attributable respiratory deaths represent a reduction of between 0.9\% and 2.4\% in overall respiratory deaths.
CONCLUSION: This study has provided evidence that extending routine influenza vaccination to all healthy children aged 2 and 3 years old leads to benefits in terms of reduced utilization of healthcare resources and fewer respiratory health outcomes and deaths.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background. The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now pandemic. Reliable estimates of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are essential to guide control efforts and to plan health care system requirements. The objectives of this study are to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data; 2) give estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for bias in the two regions with the world9s highest numbers of confirmed Covid-19 deaths: Hubei province, China and northern Italy. Method and Findings. We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases; preferential ascertainment of severe cases and delayed mortality (right-censoring). We fitted our transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei province (1 January to 11 February 2020) and northern Italy (8 February to 3 March 2020). Overall mortality among all symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was estimated to be 3.0\% (95\% credible interval: 2.6-3.4\%) in Hubei province and 3.3\% (2.0-4.7\%) in northern Italy. Mortality increased with age; we estimate that among 80+ year olds, 39.0\% (95\%CrI: 31.1-48.9\%) in Hubei province and 89.0\% (95\%CrI: 56.2-99.6\%) in northern Italy dies or will die. Limitations are that the model requires data recorded by date of onset and that sex-disaggregated mortality was not available. Conclusions. We developed a mechanistic approach to correct the crude CFR for bias due to right-censoring and preferential ascertainment and provide adjusted estimates of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection by age group. While specific to the situation in Hubei, China and northern Italy during these periods, these findings will help the mitigation efforts and planning of resources as other regions prepare for SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
