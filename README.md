# covid19epi

Shiny app for modelling how COVID 19 epidemics may be affected by pharmaceutical interventions. 

The app uses a populational SEIR with a realistic demographic structure and allows for impact of different NPIs and PIs. Exact methodological details are provided in the Shiny app.

The tool is being built at [Certara](www.certara.com) for [Gates Therapeutics Accelerator](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/TheOptimist/Articles/coronavirus-mark-suzman-therapeutics). This app is currently in a prototype stage.
